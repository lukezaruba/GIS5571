<b>Spatial Optimization of Alternative Fueling Stations in the Twin Cities</b>

<i> With renewable energy and sustainable transportation becoming key focuses for urban planning and development in the coming decades, infrastructure for supplying sustainable alternative fuels for transportation will become a key issue, especially given the United States’ reliance upon gas and oil, along with the country’s aging energy system. In order to efficiently and effectively provide adequate alternative fueling infrastructure to the nation, GIS and spatial data science techniques can be used to optimize coverage and minimize costs. This project aims to use two prominent methods developed in the field of operations research, for optimizing the rollout of alternative fueling stations in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) by maximizing coverage and minimizing resources. The project will show how the techniques can be used at a local or regional level, but the analysis is scalable, and can be used at much smaller scales (larger extents), like across the U.S. Interstate System. </i>
